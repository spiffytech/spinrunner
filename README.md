SpinRunner
==========

SpinRunner is a simple assistant for running SpinRite through VirtualBox. Designed to operate on a live CD, SpinRunner handles the messy parts of using SpinRite with VirtualBox by creating the raw virtual disks automatically. The user should be able to just boot the live CD, tell SpinRunner what drive has their copy of SpinRite, and see SpinRite come up inside VirtualBox.

The point of all of this is to run SpinRite on a broader range of hard drives and motherboards than SpinRite 6.0 supports, by capitalizing on Linux' broader driver ecosystem.
